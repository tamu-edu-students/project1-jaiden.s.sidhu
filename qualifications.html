            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            Welcome to my qualifications page! Here, you'll find a summary of my technical skills, areas of interest, and a link to my resume. I am passionate about technology and continuously strive to enhance my expertise in various domains.<br><br>
            Ever since I first started coding, I have been fascinated by the ways technology can solve real-world problems and make life better for people, particularly in areas that support sustainability and long-term positive change. What began as simple curiosity soon grew into a lifelong commitment to learning, building, and innovating. Technology, for me, is more than just tools and programs. It is a way to create meaningful impact.<br><br>
            Over the past 8 years, I have had the opportunity to dive deeply into many areas of Computer Science. My journey has included developing full-scale software applications, performing detailed data analysis, and experimenting with artificial intelligence models. These experiences taught me how to translate abstract ideas into working solutions, while also considering scalability, performance, and usability. I enjoy tackling challenging problems and have become comfortable working on enterprise-level projects where precision and reliability are critical.<br><br>
            Along the way, I have built a strong foundation in programming languages such as Python, Java, and JavaScript, while also gaining familiarity with frameworks, cloud technologies, and collaborative development practices like version control and agile workflows. Each project I take on has strengthened my problem-solving skills and ability to adapt to new tools and methodologies. I believe that staying curious and open to change is the key to thriving in a fast-moving field like technology.<br><br>
            Ultimately, what motivates me most is the potential of technology to improve lives. Whether through sustainability initiatives, smarter data-driven decisions, or accessible software solutions, I am committed to applying my skills to create meaningful and lasting contributions.
